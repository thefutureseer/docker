By following these steps, you can build a Docker-optimized 
image for your Next.js project and deploy the server using 
Docker. This allows for consistent and reproducible 
deployments across different environments.

  1: Building a Docker-Optimized Image:
Create a file named Dockerfile in the root directory 
of your Next.js project.

 2: Building the Docker Image:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the root directory of 
your Next.js project (where the 
Dockerfile is located).
Run the following command to build the Docker image:

> docker build -t your-image-name .

Replace 'your-image-name' with a desired name for 
your Docker image. Wait for the image to be built. 
This process may take some time, depending on the 
size of your project and the dependencies.

  3: Deploying the Server using Docker:
Once the image is built, you can deploy the server 
using Docker by running the following command:

docker run -p 3000:3000 your-image-name

Replace 'your-image-name' with the name you specified 
during image building. Docker will create a container 
based on your image and start the Next.js server inside 
it. The -p option maps port 3000 from the container to 
the same port on the host machine, allowing you to 
access the server at http://localhost:3000.
